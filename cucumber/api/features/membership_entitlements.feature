Feature: Manage the role entitlements through the API

  As an affordance for users to manage the entitlements for group membership,
  there are two API endpoints for granting and revoking role membership.

  Background:
    Given I am the super-user
    And I successfully PUT "/policies/cucumber/policy/root" with body:
    """
    - !user alice
    - !user bob

    - !policy
      id: dev
      body:     
      - !group developers

    - !grant
      role: !group dev/developers
      member: !user alice

    - !permit
      resource: !policy root
      privileges: [ create, update ]
      roles: !user alice
    """

  Scenario: Add a group membership through the API

    When I successfully POST "/roles/cucumber/group/dev%2Fdevelopers?members&member=cucumber:user:bob"
    And I successfully GET "/roles/cucumber/group/dev%2Fdevelopers"
    Then the JSON at "members" should be:
    """
    [
      {
        "admin_option": true,
        "member": "cucumber:policy:dev",
        "ownership": true,
        "policy": "cucumber:policy:root",
        "role": "cucumber:group:dev/developers"
      },
      {
        "admin_option": false,
        "member": "cucumber:user:alice",
        "ownership": false,
        "policy": "cucumber:policy:root",
        "role": "cucumber:group:dev/developers"
      },
      {
        "admin_option": false,
        "member": "cucumber:user:bob",
        "ownership": false,
        "role": "cucumber:group:dev/developers"
      }
    ]
    """

  Scenario: Revoke a group membership through the API
    
    Given I login as "alice"
    When I successfully DELETE "/roles/cucumber/group/dev%2Fdevelopers?members&member=cucumber:user:alice"
    And I successfully GET "/roles/cucumber/group/dev%2Fdevelopers"
    Then the JSON at "members" should be:
    """
    [
      {
        "admin_option": true,
        "member": "cucumber:policy:dev",
        "ownership": true,
        "policy": "cucumber:policy:root",
        "role": "cucumber:group:dev/developers"
      }
    ]
    """
    And the last audit record matches:
    """
      <37>1 * * conjur * policy [auth@43868 user="cucumber:user:alice"]
      [subject@43868 role="cucumber:group:dev/developers" member="cucumber:user:alice"]
      [action@43868 operation="remove"]
      cucumber:user:alice removed membership of cucumber:user:alice in cucumber:group:dev/developers
    """
    # TBD: should a [policy@] sdid be present?

  Scenario: Add a membership without permissions

    Given I login as "bob"
    When I POST "/roles/cucumber/group/dev%2Fdevelopers?members&member=cucumber:user:bob"
    Then the HTTP response status code is 403

  Scenario: Attempt to add a member twice

    When I successfully POST "/roles/cucumber/group/dev%2Fdevelopers?members&member=cucumber:user:bob"
    And I successfully POST "/roles/cucumber/group/dev%2Fdevelopers?members&member=cucumber:user:bob"
    And I successfully GET "/roles/cucumber/group/dev%2Fdevelopers"
    Then the JSON at "members" should be:
    """
