Feature: Adding and fetching secrets

  Each resource in Possum has an associated list of "secrets", each of which is an arbitrary
  piece of encrypted data. Access to secrets is governed by privileges:

  - **execute** permission to fetch the value of a secret
  - **update** permission to change the value of a secret

  The list of secrets on a resource is appended when a new secret value is added. The list
  is capped to the last 20 secret values in order to limit the size of the backend database.

  Secrets are encrypted using AES-25C-GCM.

  Background:
    Given I am a user named "eve"
    Given I create a new "variable" resource called "probe"

  Scenario: When a new resource has no secret values, fetching the secret results in a 404 error.

    When I GET "/secrets/cucumber/variable/probe"
    Then the HTTP response status code is 404

  Scenario: The 'conjur/mime_type' annotation is used in the value response.

    If the annotation `conjur/mime_type` exists on a resource, then when a secret value is fetched
    from the resource, that mime type is used as the `Content-Type` header in the response. 

    Given I set annotation "conjur/mime_type" to "application/json"
    And I successfully POST "/secrets/cucumber/variable/probe" with body:
    """
    [ "v-1" ]
    """
    When I successfully GET "/secrets/cucumber/variable/probe"
    Then the JSON should be:
    """
    [ "v-1" ]
    """

  Scenario: Secrets can contain any binary data.

    Given I create a binary secret value
    When I successfully GET "/secrets/cucumber/variable/probe"
    Then the binary result is preserved

  Scenario: When fetching a secret, the last secret in the secrets list is the default.

    Adding a new secret appends to a list of values on the resource. When retrieving secrets,
    the last value in the list is returned by default.

    Given I successfully POST "/secrets/cucumber/variable/probe" with body:
    """
    v-1
    """
    And I successfully POST "/secrets/cucumber/variable/probe" with body:
    """
    v-2
    """
    When I successfully GET "/secrets/cucumber/variable/probe"
    Then the binary result is "v-2"

  Scenario: When fetching a secret, a specific secret index can be specified.

    The `version` parameter can be used to select a specific secret value from the list.

    Given I successfully POST "/secrets/cucumber/variable/probe" with body:
    """
    v-1
    """
    And I successfully POST "/secrets/cucumber/variable/probe" with body:
    """
    v-2
    """
    When I successfully GET "/secrets/cucumber/variable/probe?version=1"
    Then the binary result is "v-1"

  Scenario: Fetching a secret with a non-existant secret version results in a 404 error.

    Given I successfully POST "/secrets/cucumber/variable/probe" with body:
    """
    v-1
    """
    When I GET "/secrets/cucumber/variable/probe?version=2"
    Then the HTTP response status code is 404

  Scenario: When creating a secret, the value parameter is required.

    When I POST "/secrets/cucumber/variable/probe" with body:
    """
    """
    Then the HTTP response status code is 422

  Scenario: Only the last 20 versions of a secret are stored.
  
    Given I create 20 secret values
    And I successfully POST "/secrets/cucumber/variable/probe" with body:
    """
    v-21
    """
    When I GET "/secrets/cucumber/variable/probe?version=1"
    Then the HTTP response status code is 404
